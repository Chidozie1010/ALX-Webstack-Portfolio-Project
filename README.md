<h1>A Blog Website</h1>
<p>This Blog website was designed and developed by me as one of the statutory project in my software development project with Binance/Utiva. The root folder has two direcories inside it, namely:
<ul>
<li><h2>API folder</h2>
<p>This holds the backend part of the project, all the behind the scene functionalities on the website are in this folder, it has a model folder where user and posts were modelled, the index.js is where CRUD concept and REST api works, all datas are being stored in the mongoDB database, with mongoose</p>
</li>
<li><h2>Client folder</h2>
<p>This hold the frontend of the project, the loginpage, the registerpage, postpage, create page, edit page and all it's components are in this folder, the concept of useEffect, useContext, useStates were all used in the project. ReactQuill as a React package was also used.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event packages are not working on the project, you can run <b>npm install</b> to install all dependencies.</p>

<em>Gracias</em>
